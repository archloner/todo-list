# todoism - task management application
Simple todo list fullstack application written in Svelte and Spring using MongoDB

You can check the app [here](https://philbjern.github.io/todo-list/)

I'm currently working on:
* developing backend API with Mongo database integration in Spring 
* migrating existing frontend to ~~React~~ Svelte
* integrating front with backend

I will try to deploy the entire application on Netlify sometime in the future
